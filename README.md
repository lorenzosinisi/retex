# Retex

![Elixir CI](https://github.com/lorenzosinisi/retex/workflows/Elixir%20CI/badge.svg)

**Boilerplate/PoC of a version of the Rete Algorithm implementated in Elixir**

Rete is a complex stateful algorithm, this is an attempt of reproducing it with some slight modifications, using a functional immutable language such as Elixir/Erlang. [Read more about Rete](http://www.csl.sri.com/users/mwfong/Technical/RETE%20Match%20Algorithm%20-%20Forgy%20OCR.pdf)


## Concepts

- Retex compiles the rules using a directed acyclic graph data structure
- The activation of nodes is done using a [State Monad and Forward Chaining](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303626297_Forward_Chaining_with_State_Monad).
- A list of bindinds is stored at each active node in order to generate complete matches from partial ones

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:neural_bridge, git: "https://github.com/lorenzosinisi/neural_bridge"}
  ]
end
```


## Examples and usage with NeuralBridge (a wrapper around Retex)

### Generic inferred knowledge

```elixir
    alias NeuralBridge.{Engine, Rule}
    engine = Engine.new("test")

    rules = [
      Rule.new(
        id: 1,
        given: """
        Person's name is equal "bob"
        """,
        then: """
        Person's age is 23
        """
      ),
      Rule.new(
        id: 2,
        given: """
        Person's name is equal $name
        Person's age is equal 23
        """,
        then: fn production ->
          require Logger
          bindings = Map.get(production, :bindings)
          Logger.info(inspect(bindings))
        end
      )
    ]

    engine = Engine.add_rules(engine, rules)
    engine = Engine.add_facts(engine, "Person's name is \"bob\"")
    rule = List.first(engine.rule_engine.agenda)
    engine = Engine.apply_rule(engine, rule)

    Enum.each(engine.rule_engine.agenda, fn pnode ->
        Engine.apply_rule(engine, pnode)
        end)
    end # will log %{"$name" => "bob"}

```

### Medical diagnosis

```elixir
    alias NeuralBridge.{Engine, Rule}
    engine = Engine.new("doctor_AI")

    engine =
      Engine.add_rules(engine, [
        Rule.new(
          id: 1,
          given: """
          Patient's fever is greater 38.5
          Patient's name is equal $name
          Patient's generic_weakness is equal "Yes"
          """,
          then: """
          Patient's diagnosis is "flu"
          """
        ),
        Rule.new(
          id: 2,
          given: """
          Patient's fever is lesser 38.5
          Patient's name is equal $name
          Patient's generic_weakness is equal "No"
          """,
          then: """
          Patient's diagnosis is "all good"
          """
        )
      ])

    engine =
      Engine.add_facts(engine, """
      Patient's fever is 39
      Patient's name is "Aylon"
      Patient's generic_weakness is "Yes"
      """)

    ## contains Patient's diagnnosis
    [
      %_{
        action: [
          %Retex.Wme{
            identifier: "Patient",
            attribute: "diagnosis",
            value: "flu"
          }
        ],
        bindings: %{"$name" => "Aylon"}
      }
    ] = engine.rule_engine.agenda

```
